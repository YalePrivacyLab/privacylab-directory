# Yale Privacy Lab - Directory

## Who We Are

[Yale Privacy Lab](https://privacylab.yale.edu) explores the connection between privacy, security, and anonymity through hands-on software and hardware implementation. It provides cybersecurity workshops and demonstrations, strengthening the networks between technologists, lawyers, students, and researchers.

Yale Privacy Lab is an iniative of the [Information Society Project](https://www.law.yale.edu/isp) at Yale Law School. It is currently a volunteer effort driven by founder and Lab Director [Sean O'Brien](https://webio.me) and Lab Coordinator [Michael Kwet](https://mikekwet.com).

## Directory Purpose

Weâ€™re often challenged to communicate over surveillance networks, trading privacy for convenience. As a community that values privacy, security, and anonymity, we need accurate and verifiable contacts, whether we intend to share secrets or just chat.

The heart of every network needs healthy information to keep beating. This directory intends to provide that data, in an attempt to strengthen our bonds and increase our strength.

Sure, you can look up e-mail addresses in a [keyserver](https://pgp.mit.edu) or find people on [Keybase](https://keybase.io). This directory serves a different purpose, connecting you specifically with Yale Privacy Lab and professionals trained in digital self-defense in the Yale and New Haven communities. Our network centers around the [Information Society Project](https://law.yale.edu/isp), [Yale Law School](https://www.law.yale.edu), and [YLS Clinics](https://law.yale.edu/clinics/our-clinics) and reaches outward to privacy-respecting friends and colleagues at other institutions.
